# Thesis Code Challenge

Not much to talk about here except for some of the functionality I've added:

- When focusing on a form input, the value will clear if it's the same as the name of the input. This was needed to match the mock because placeholders cannot be styled.
- When leaving a form input, the name of that form will reappear if no value has been entered.
- The password hide button can be used to toggle hiding the password.
- The menu button opens a full-screen navigation menu, with an X to close.
- A few interesting hover styles: the nav menu items, logo, and submit button.
